# FA-PLS-MANN-Wind-Power-Prediction
## Abstract
The increasing reliance on renewable energy sources like wind power necessitates accurate prediction capabilities for efficient grid integration. This research proposes a novel deep learning approach that combines probabilistic latent space model and memory augmented neural networks for improved wind power prediction. The proposed architecture, named Feature-Augmented Probabilistic Latent Space and Memory Augmented Neural Network (FA-PLS-MANN), leverages the ability of probabilistic latent space model to learn a compressed latent representation of high-dimensional wind speed and direction data. This latent space captures the most significant features influencing wind power generation. The extracted latent features are subsequently fed into a memory augmented neural network, capitalizing on its strengths in time series forecasting. This synergistic approach aims to outperform existing wind power prediction methods by focusing on the most relevant data characteristics within the compressed latent space. The research will evaluate the proposed FA-PLS-MANN model on historical wind data and corresponding power generation records. The model's performance will be compared with established prediction techniques, including standalone memory augmented neural network and traditional statistical models. Through hyperparameter tuning and potential architecture variations, the research will strive to optimize the FA-PLS-MANN model for enhanced wind power prediction accuracy. The Spatial Dynamic Wind Power Forecasting (SDWPF) dataset, obtained from the Baidu KDD CUP 2022 challenge and released by Longyuan Power Group, will be used for experimental analysis.
